# DTSA 5509 Supervised Learning Final Project: Pet Adoption Prediction
In the recent years, animal shelters in Los Angeles and Orange County are facing overcrowding crisis. The rate at which animals are brought into the shelters way exceeded the rate at which animals were adopted. As someone who had personally adopted two cats (one from a shelter and another from an animal rescue) and had worked with a rescue to foster four kittens for adoption, this topic is important to me.
This project intends to perform a thorough analysis on a pet adoption dataset to better understand features that mostly contribute to adoption. This project will use supervised learning algorithms since data labels are available with the dataset. This is a regression task because the goal of the project is to predict the likelihood of a pet being adopted based on various features and attributes within this dataset.
